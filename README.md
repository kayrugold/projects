# Math Programs

This repository contains a collection of my math programs, written in various languages.

## Overview

The projects are organized by language or platform into the following directories:

- **`cpp/`**: Contains programs written in C++.
- **`javascript-html/`**: Contains web-based programs using JavaScript and HTML.
- **`mobile-apps/`**: Contains mobile applications for Android or iOS.

Feel free to browse the different projects in their respective directories. Each project will have its own README with more specific details.

## Projects

### JavaScript/HTML Projects

This directory contains a variety of interactive, web-based math explorers.

- **[Number Theory Factor Finder](./javascript-html/factor-hunter/factor-hunter.html)**: An advanced tool for finding factors of numbers of the form `a^b + c`. It uses web workers for parallel processing to handle large numbers.

- **[Prime Factory: Builder & Explorer](./javascript-html/factorexplorer0.0.0/factorexplorer0.0.0.html)**: A dual-mode application. The "Builder" allows you to construct composite numbers from prime blocks, while the "Explorer" helps visualize and investigate the properties of large numbers.

- **[Modular Number Explorer](./javascript-html/modexplorer0.0.0/modexplorer0.0.0.html)**: A visual tool for understanding modular arithmetic. It allows you to create and interact with "clocks" of different moduli to see how numbers wrap around.

- **[Number Grid Visualizer](./javascript-html/primegrid0.0.0.html/primegrid0.0.0.html)**: An interactive grid for exploring prime numbers. You can visualize the distribution of primes, highlight patterns (like twin primes), and find factors of a target number.

### C++ and Mobile App Projects

The `cpp/` and `mobile-apps/` directories are currently placeholders for future projects.
