We are currently on factorexplorer0.0.3.html - we have completed step 1. Now I'm thinking about adding ui enhancements in step 2. This is a js app - end goal is a phone app 
combining all three of these programs. We completed dark mode / light mode for #2 simplified theme. Problem: Doesn't look right in either theme. WIll need to fix.
Open this up tomorrow keep working at factorexplorerer 0.0.4

Of course. This is already a very powerful and unique suite of tools. The combination of visual/tactile exploration with high-performance computation is fantastic. Based on the current functionality, here are several potential enhancements, ranging from simple quality-of-life improvements to more advanced features that would significantly boost its capabilities.

### 1. Cross-Tool Integration & Synergy

The biggest opportunity is to make the three tabs "talk" to each other. This would transform them from separate tools into a truly integrated analysis suite.

* **Hunter ? Explorer:**
    * **"Visualize Factor" Button:** Next to each factor found in the Hunter's log, add a "Visualize" button.
    * **Functionality:** Clicking this would automatically switch to the **Explorer** tab, load the original number ($a^b + c$), and set the rectangle's dimensions to the factor and its corresponding cofactor ($N/factor$). This would provide an immediate, powerful visual confirmation of the discovered factor.

* **Builder ? Explorer:**
    * **"Explore this Number" Button:** In the Builder UI, add a button that takes the current composite number made from the blocks.
    * **Functionality:** Clicking it would switch to the **Explorer** tab and load that composite number, allowing you to visually explore its different factor pairs with the resizable rectangle. This creates a great workflow from hands-on building to analytical visualization.

### 2. General UI/UX Improvements

These changes would make the entire application feel more polished and user-friendly.

* **Unified Theme:** The application currently mixes a dark mode (Builder) with light modes (Explorer/Hunter). Adding a single **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** that affects the entire application would create a more cohesive experience.
* **Help & Instructions:** Each tool is complex. A small `?` icon on each tab that opens a simple modal explaining the purpose and basic controls of that specific tool would greatly improve usability for new users.
* **Persistent History:** Add a collapsible side panel that keeps a history of the numbers you've worked on across all three tabs. This would allow you to quickly recall a number you were factoring in the Hunter and visualize it in the Explorer without re-typing.

### 3. "Explorer" Mode Enhancements

* **Automatic Cofactor Snapping:** When you resize the rectangle and the width becomes a perfect factor of the total number, the height could **automatically snap** to the correct cofactor ($Height = TotalBlocks / Width$). This would provide a very satisfying and immediate "click" when a factor is found.
* **Labeled Grid Axes:** When zoomed in, the grid lines could display numeric labels (e.g., 10, 20, 30...). This would make it easier to orient yourself on the grid and estimate dimensions without constantly looking at the info panel.
* **Additional Number Formats:** The input could be enhanced to parse other famous number theory forms, such as factorials ($n! \pm 1$) or primorials ($p\# \pm 1$), making it a more versatile research tool.

### 4. "Hunter" Mode Enhancements

* **Estimated Time Remaining (ETR):** For long-running scans, the Hunter could calculate the time taken to process the last few chunks and provide an estimated time remaining for the entire range.
* **Pause and Resume:** Add a "Pause" button that temporarily stops the workers without terminating them, allowing the scan to be resumed later. This is useful if you need your CPU for another task briefly.
* **Advanced Algorithm Options:** For extremely large numbers, you could consider adding (as a future goal) options to use more advanced factoring algorithms like **Pollard's Rho** for finding small-to-medium factors quickly before starting the main brute-force scan.

### 5. "Builder" Mode Enhancements

* **Block Snapping:** Make the prime blocks "snap" together magnetically when they are dragged close to each other. This would make it easier and more satisfying to build perfect rectangles.
* **Canonical Factorization Display:** In addition to the "Composite" number, display the prime factorization in standard mathematical notation (e.g., $2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^2$). This would reinforce the link between the visual blocks and the mathematical concept.

Implementing even a few of the cross-tool integration ideas would make this application a truly exceptional educational and exploratory tool.
