We don't have to sieve. Everything starts with 3.

3x3 3x5 3x7 3x9 3x11 ...
5x5 5x7 5x9 5x11 5x13 ...
7x7 7x9 7x11 7x13 7x15 ...
There's a simple pattern here.

If I want to find factors of and know if 179 is prime I just set the lower wall at the first odd composite before 179 and the higher wall at the first odd composite after 179.

Then I calculate it's lower position in the arithmetic I layed out above, and it's higher Wall position in the arithmetic. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't need to look at the whole lines of 3, 5, 7, etc., to figure out that numbers wall positions. I just need to find the previous odd composites place relative to 3 and calculate.

It can probably be seen on an odds multiplication table easily.

Now I know if 179 is composite, and what it's factors are.

It all just counts up and increments by 2

Every cell in this upper-triangle (including the diagonal) is a composite odd number, and every composite odd number appears at least once.
Now here’s the key insight you had:
The composite odd numbers form “walls” or “bars” that block out entire arithmetic progressions.
Between two consecutive composite walls, everything is either prime or 1.

Gosh, it's more direct than that.

23
21[3x7] 23[1x23] 25[5x5] 27[3x9]

I just put 27 in there to observe the 3 pattern.

21 is composite odd in sequence with 25[square odd]  and 27[composite 3 sequence odd].

All I had to was take the sqrt of 25 to know it's composite

21%3=0, composite
23 has to be Prime.
It's not a sieve.

/*Another way to look at it that's a little off:

Here is the clean multiplication pattern for composites only, showing exactly how the Current Line creates the Next Line using your A+2 * B+2 rule.

The Projection Pattern
You run the 3-line (A). Every time you write a calculation, you add 2 to both numbers to create the task for the 5-line (B).
Line 1: The 3-Family (The Source)
 * 3 \times 3 = 9 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 5 \times 5
 * 3 \times 5 = 15 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 5 \times 7
 * 3 \times 7 = 21 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 5 \times 9
 * 3 \times 9 = 27 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 5 \times 11
 * 3 \times 11 = 33 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 5 \times 13
 * 3 \times 13 = 39 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 5 \times 15
 * 3 \times 15 = 45 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 5 \times 17
Line 2: The 5-Family (Generated from above)
 * 5 \times 5 = 25 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 7 \times 7
 * 5 \times 7 = 35 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 7 \times 9
 * 5 \times 9 = 45 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 7 \times 11
 * 5 \times 11 = 55 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 7 \times 13
 * 5 \times 13 = 65 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 7 \times 15
Line 3: The 7-Family (Generated from above)
 * 7 \times 7 = 49 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 9 \times 9
 * 7 \times 9 = 63 \rightarrow (Add 2 to both) \rightarrow Creates 9 \times 11
 *  * Line 4: The 9-Family (Phantom)
 *  * This pattern is purely mechanical. You don't need to know if a number is prime or square; you just apply +2 to the previous family's factors to build the next family's schedule.

/* Another way to look at it:
​1. The Logic of the "Projection" (The +2 Rule)
​You noticed this pattern in your text file:
​Line 1 (3-Family): 3 \times 3 \rightarrow add 2 to both \rightarrow Line 2 (5-Family): 5 \times 5
Line 1 (3-Family): 3 \times 5 \rightarrow add 2 to both \rightarrow Line 2 (5-Family): 5 \times 7
​Here is the math explaining why this works:
You are working on a grid of odd numbers.
Let's call the position of a number (x, y), where x and y are the odd numbers you are multiplying.
​Your current composite is C_1 = A \times B.
​You move "diagonally" down your grid by adding 2 to the row number (A) and 2 to the column number (B).
​Your new composite is C_2 = (A+2) \times (B+2).
​You aren't just guessing; you are physically shifting the entire multiplication table diagonally. This means if you calculate the entire "3-line" (multiples of 3), you can mathematically generate the "5-line" just by shifting the factors up by 2.
​Why is this powerful?
It means odd composites define each other. You don't need to perform expensive division to find the "5-line" composites; you can just derive them from the "3-line" you already calculated.
​2. The "Walls" and the "Gap"
​In your app screenshots, you show "Lower Wall 99" and "Upper Wall 105" with "101" in the middle.
​The Wall: A "Wall" is simply where one of your generated composite numbers lands on the number line.
​The Gap: The space between two Walls.
​The Prime: Any number that exists inside a Gap and is NOT a Wall itself.
​Your insight is that if you project these lines forward (3x, 5x, 7x...), you are painting "stripes" on the number line.

3. Validating your "Gap Scanner"
​Your visual of the grid (in 1000070714.jpg) is functionally identical to the Sieve of Sundaram.
​In Sundaram's logic, you remove numbers of the form:

i + j + 2ij
multiply 2 add 1
(2i + 1)(2j + 1)
It is the multiplication of two odd numbers.

wall--->99 101 103 105<--- wall That's key, Important
3x33 P P 3x35
A[3]*B[33] P P A(3)*B+2[35]
That is the pattern I seek to isolate, and calculate

Find the walls. CALCULATE.

That's pretty close to a formula.


I just need to to know where we are at in the arithmetic progression between the walls, because the pattern exists.

3x3 3x5 3x7 3x9
5x5 5x7 5x9 5x11
7x7 7x9 7x11 7x13
9x9 9x11 9x13 9x15
11x11 11x13 11x15 11x17

So first, all we need is the number.

53 % 3 equiv 14 Rem 1
51 % 3 equiv 17 Rem 0
55 % 3 equiv 18 Rem 1

List target and surrounding odd integers
51 53 55

Sqrt(51) is 7 roughly
7*7 is 49

How do i break this down to a 3x5 5x7 7x9 progression?

Ie
51=3*17
53
55=5*11
