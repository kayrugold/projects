We don't know the factors.

We have no way to derive that without the factors yet.

The gnomon gives us the index, square, arm length, and the odd corner.

These images might help.

The multiplication table gives us the rhythm and the square that starts each band - is this too a gnomon?

Looks similar. Squares are the corners and the start of the bands. Arms are the bands. Shows the equations their patterns and rhythms. Can also be indexed.


Yes, the multiplication table you're describing for odd numbers does share structural similarities with the concept of gnomons, especially in how it builds layers or "bands" around central squares, revealing patterns in a rhythmic, indexed way. Let me break this down step by step to connect the dots based on what you've outlined, and explain why it can be viewed as gnomon-like.

### Quick Recap on Gnomons for Squares
You're spot on with the gnomon examples you listed. In classical number theory (dating back to the Greeks), a gnomon is the "L-shaped" addition that turns one square into the next larger square. For odd numbers as gnomons:
- Start with 1 (which is 1²).
- Add 3 (2×1 + 1) to get 4 = 2².
- Add 5 (2×2 + 1) to get 9 = 3².
- Add 7 (2×3 + 1) to get 16 = 4².
- Add 9 (2×4 + 1) to get 25 = 5².
- And so on.

The general formula for the gnomon to go from (n-1)² to n² is 2n - 1, which is always the next odd number. These "corners" are the odd numbers themselves, and the "arm length" relates to the index (n), as you noted. This makes computations fast because you can build squares incrementally: n² = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1), which is the sum of the first n odd numbers.

The difference between consecutive squares is exactly that gnomon: n² - (n-1)² = 2n - 1. Indexing them (e.g., gnomon for index k is 2k + 1, starting from k=0 for 1) adds a nice rhythmic pattern, like a sequence where each step extends the previous "arm."

### The Odd Multiplication Table as a Gnomon-Like Structure
Now, onto your table:

```
1×1   1×3   1×5   1×7   ...
      3×3   3×5   3×7   3×9   ...
            5×5   5×7   5×9   5×11  ...
                  7×7   7×9   7×11  7×13  ...
```

This is a lower-triangular multiplication table restricted to odd multipliers (1,3,5,7,...). Each "band" (row) starts with the square of an odd number: 1²=1, 3²=9, 5²=25, 7²=49, etc. Then it extends "arm"-like with products of that odd number times the subsequent odds.

Why does this feel like a gnomon?
- **Squares as "Corners" or Starting Points**: Just like in the square gnomon, where each new layer starts at a square and adds an L-shaped arm of odd length, here each band kicks off with an odd square (the "corner"). These squares anchor the structure, much like how 1,4,9,16,25 anchor the gnomon additions in your earlier list.
- **Bands as "Arms"**: The extensions in each row (e.g., after 9: 3×5=15, 3×7=21, etc.) act like the arms of a gnomon—they "wrap around" the previous layer. If you visualize this table as a growing figure, adding a new row is like adding a new gnomon layer: it starts at the next odd square and extends outward with a rhythmic sequence of products.
- **Rhythms and Patterns**: The differences or increments often tie back to odds. For example, in a row like 3×3=9, 3×5=15, 3×7=21, the differences are 6,6,... (multiples of the row's starting odd minus something? Wait, 15-9=6=3×2, 21-15=6=3×2). More deeply, the entire table encodes the fact that products of odds are always odd, and the diagonals are the odd squares themselves (reading down the starting points).
- **Indexing and Efficiency**: You can index the rows by the odd numbers' position (row m starts with (2m-1)²). This makes it "blazing fast" for computations, similar to gnomons—e.g., to find a product, locate the row and column index without full multiplication. It's like a lookup with built-in patterns, and the gnomon analogy helps because you can "build" the table incrementally, adding bands without recalculating everything.

Is this *literally* a gnomon? Not in the strict geometric sense (gnomons are typically for plane figures like squares or parallelograms). But conceptually, yes—it's gnomon-*inspired* or analogous, as it builds a larger structure by adding layered "arms" around core squares, revealing differences, rhythms, and indices. In fact, some visualizations of multiplication tables (like array diagrams) show products as areas, and restricting to odds creates a stepped, gnomon-like growth.

### Deeper Connections and Why It's Useful
- **Link to Factors**: You mentioned not knowing factors yet—this setup might help derive them indirectly. For instance, since the table highlights odd composites (like 15=3×5, 21=3×7), it could aid in factoring odds by pattern recognition (e.g., spotting rhythms in prime products). Gnomons themselves relate to factorization via differences of squares: a² - b² = (a-b)(a+b), which is gnomon-related since differences are odds.
- **Patterns in Equations**: Each band follows an arithmetic sequence in its differences (as above), tied to the starting odd. This is rhythmic like gnomons, where arms lengthen predictably (by 2 each time).
- **Visualization**: If you were to draw this as a grid or spiral, it might look like a Ulam spiral variant for odds, with squares at corners and arms radiating out. That could make the gnomon parallel even clearer.
