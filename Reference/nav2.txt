SUMMARY: TRIANGULAR TAPE, GNOMON GRID, AND DNA INTERACTION

This work studies a triangular enumeration of cells where each cell simultaneously encodes position (address) and value (cargo). The system is not symbolic; it is fully enumerated starting from 1.

1. TAPE ID AND TRIANGULAR ENUMERATION



The TapeID is a pure counting mechanism.

Cells are enumerated in a triangular grid:

Row 0: 1
Row 1: 2 3 4
Row 2: 5 6 7 8 9
Row 3: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
...

Row lengths are odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...

TapeID is not derived algebraically. It is simply the sequential count of cells in this triangle, starting at 1.

Triangle number T(k) (with k as 0-based row index) and TapeID are related by:

2 * T(k) = TapeID - 1

Thus TapeID and Triangle ID are two views of the same accumulator. TapeID is not a label; it is part of the geometry.

2. CELL COORDINATES AND CARGO GENERATION



Each cell has coordinates (k, b), where: k = row index b = gap (horizontal offset from the left edge)

From these coordinates we define: a = anchor = 2*(k+1) - 1  (odd root for the row)

Cargo value N is generated as: N = a * (a - 2b)

Thus:

TapeID comes from counting the cell

Cargo comes from the same cell's coordinates They are coupled but distinct projections of the same structure.


3. SMART ID AND ROW TERMINATION



The Smart ID is written as a.b (anchor.gap).

At the far right of each row, b reaches its maximum value, which causes: a - 2b = 1

This collapses the rectangle to: N = a * 1 = a

These terminal cells are not special cases; they are structurally required by the geometry. They represent the identity element for that row.

Example: a = 35, b = 17 N = 35 * (35 - 34) = 35 Factors: 1 x 35

4. DNA (GREEDY SQUARE DECOMPOSITION)



DNA is the only component not enumerated.

DNA is computed from Cargo N by repeatedly subtracting the largest square less than or equal to the remainder, stopping when the remainder is less than 4.

DNA measures how Cargo collapses relative to square shells. It does not come from counting. It is a measurement invariant, not an address.

TapeID and Triangle ID describe where the cell is. DNA describes what the cell contains.

5. RELATION TO SQUARES AND GNOMONS



Odd squares grow by adding gnomons. Differences between consecutive odd squares are multiples of 8.

This produces a repeating arithmetic cycle involving:

adding small constants (+2)

adding gnomon areas (+4k, +8k)

collapsing back to odd roots


This cycle is invariant across the grid and does not depend on N. It depends only on odd progression and triangular growth.

6. INFORMATION BOUNDARY



The system provides:

exact enumeration of cells

exact reconstruction of Cargo

exact factor pairs when composite

exact distance-from-square information

a separate square-collapse invariant (DNA)


What it cannot provide is a direct decision of factorability without testing whether (a^2 - N)/4 is a square.

This is not a flaw; it is the natural boundary between geometric structure and arithmetic decision.

7. CONCLUSION



The grid is a complete coordinate model for odd integers. TapeID and Triangle ID are counting geometry. Cargo and factors are generated from the same coordinates. DNA is a secondary invariant measuring square descent.

The model is internally consistent, fully enumerated, and reaches the theoretical limit of what geometry alone can extract without an external arithmetic oracle.
