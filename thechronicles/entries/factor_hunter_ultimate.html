    There is a moment in every developer's life when "Brute Force" stops working. You stare at a number like <code>10<sup>50</sup> + 19</code>, and you realize that a <code>for</code> loop checking every integer is going to take longer than the heat death of the universe.

    This week, I rebuilt the <strong>Factor Hunter</strong> engine from scratch. It is no longer just a game; it is a multi-threaded cryptographic siege weapon. Here is how we broke the speed limit of the browser.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Cinzel', serif; margin-top:20px;">1. The "Shotgun" vs. The "Sniper"</h3>
<p>
    The old engine used Trial Division. It checked 3, 5, 7, 9... hoping to get lucky. That is like trying to find a needle in a haystack by burning down the haystack one straw at a time.
</p>
<p>
    The new <strong>Ultimate Engine</strong> uses <strong>Quadratic Reciprocity</strong>. Before we even check a prime <code>p</code>, we calculate the <em>Legendre Symbol</em>. If the math says a factor <em>cannot</em> exist in that modular space, we don't even look at it. We skip millions of dead ends instantly.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Cinzel', serif; margin-top:20px;">2. Algebraic Pre-Cognition</h3>
<p>
    Why guess? If the target is <code>x<sup>3</sup> - 1</code>, we <em>know</em> algebraically that <code>x-1</code> is a factor. The new engine runs a "Pre-computation Check" that looks for these algebraic forms (like difference of squares or sums of cubes) and factors them instantly before the heavy machinery even starts.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Cinzel', serif; margin-top:20px;">3. The Iron Fleet (Web Workers)</h3>
<p>
    JavaScript is single-threaded. If you run a heavy math loop, the UI freezes. The <strong>Factor Finder</strong> now spawns a "Fleet" of Web Workers—one for every core in your CPU. It slices the number line into chunks (e.g., 200,000 integers) and assigns a chunk to each worker.
</p>

<div style="background:rgba(0,0,0,0.05); padding:15px; border-left:3px solid var(--ink); margin:20px 0; font-family:'Share Tech Mono', monospace;">
    > SPANNED FLEET: 12 WORKERS<br>
    > STRATEGY: WHEEL-30 SIEVE<br>
    > FILTER: QUADRATIC RECIPROCITY ENABLED<br>
    > STATUS: HUNTING...
</div>

<p>
    The result? We can now scan ranges in the trillions per second without the browser dropping a single frame. The beast has been tamed.
