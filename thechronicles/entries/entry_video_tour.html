<p>I had to bail on my original recording spot because my coworkers were rolling in, so I retreated to the cab of the truck to film this. The lighting isn't great, and I actually ended up jump-scaring myself with my own hand reflection in the window at the 10-minute mark, but we got the mission parameters outlined.</p>

<p>In this video, I walk through exactly why Andy's Dev Studio exists. I break down Google's rigorous 14-Day/20-Tester requirement for new developers, and how this community is the ultimate answer to that hurdle. I also give a tour of how to use <strong>The Forge</strong> for free prototypes, and how to get your security clearance to test professional apps in <strong>The Rookery</strong>.</p>
