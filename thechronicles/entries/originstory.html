<h3>Forging Code on the Open Road</h3>

<p><strong>The view from my office changes every day at 65 mph.</strong></p>

<p>Most software is born in open-plan offices in Silicon Valley or quiet home studios with ergonomic chairs. The tools in this Forge are different. They are built at truck stops, rest areas, and loading docks across the American West. I am a professional truck driver by trade, and a dedicated father by choice.</p>

<p><strong>The Constraint: Time is a Monopoly</strong></p>

<p>Between the long hauls and my family duties, my time at a keyboard is extremely limited. I don't have the luxury of spending four hours chasing a missing semicolon or configuring a Webpack server. If I want to build, I have to be efficient.</p>

<p><strong>The Method: The Digital Co-Pilot</strong></p>

<p>This is why I built <strong>Andy's Dev Studio</strong> around a specific philosophy: <em>AI-Assisted Architecture.</em></p>

<p>I treat Generative AI not as a magic wand, but as a digital apprentice. I provide the logic, the mathematical theorems (like the patterns in the <a href="#" onclick="switchPage('forge')">Gnomon Navigator</a>), and the system architecture. My "co-pilot" handles the heavy lifting of syntax and boilerplate. This allows me to focus purely on the <strong>design</strong> and the <strong>math</strong> without needing a 14-person engineering team.</p>

<p><strong>The Mission</strong></p>

<p>I am not here to sell ads or harvest data. I am building these tools because I love Number Theory, and I want to visualize the hidden patterns in integers that spreadsheets can't show us.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Forge. The archives are now open.</p>
