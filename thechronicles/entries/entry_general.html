    There is a moment in number theory when "brute force" stops working. You can't just check every odd number up to the square root when the target has 80 digits. You don't need a hammer; you need a tactical team.

    This project, born during a long wait at a loading dock in Stockton, is my attempt to turn the browser into a coordinated command center. It doesn't just run a calculation; it orchestrates a war against composite numbers.

    The real beauty isn't the math—it's the architecture. I'm using <strong>Web Workers</strong> to treat every core of my phone (or laptop) as an independent soldier. The main thread sits back, acting as "The General," dispatching ranges and aggregating status reports without freezing the UI.

    It’s overkill for a homework problem. But when you’re parked at a truck stop at 2 AM, watching the "Shells Fired" count tick up on a Mersenne Prime candidate... it feels less like math and more like a siege.
