<h3>Visualizing the Modulus</h3>

<p>The <strong>Residue Scanner</strong> is now in Beta (v0.8). My goal was to create a "Gnomon Navigator" that highlights patterns in modular arithmetic that are usually invisible in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>By mapping integers to a grid and highlighting <code>n % k</code>, distinct geometric artifacts appear. Specifically, when the modulus aligns with prime factors, we see clear "streets" of clear space.</p>

<p>I've optimized the rendering loop so it handles grids up to 10,000 cells without dropping frames on mobile. This is crucial for checking patterns while away from the desktop.</p>
