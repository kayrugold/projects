            I just got back from a heavy 500-mile shift, and while I’m definitely feeling the hours, I couldn't go to sleep without hitting "publish" on a major update to the site. 
        </p>

        <h3>Beyond the Digital Forge</h3>
        <p>
            Up until now, my focus at <strong>Andy’s Dev Studio</strong> has been almost entirely on the code—building math engines like <strong>Factor Hunter</strong> and trying to make browser-based processing as efficient as possible. But as a trucker, I know that at the end of the day, someone has to move the physical freight.
        </p>

        <p>
            That’s why I’ve added <strong>The Cargo Bay</strong> to the main library. 
        </p>

        <h3>Physical Provisions for the Modern Forger</h3>
        <p>
            The Cargo Bay is a dedicated space for physical goods and gear. I’m starting small while I finalize the inventory, but the first prototype is already on the shelf: the <strong>Official Factor Hunter Tee</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It features the "Ink on Parchment" design we’ve been using in the Forge, meant to represent the blend of old-school number theory and modern high-performance code.

        <h3>What's Next?</h3>
        <p>
            I don't have a massive catalog yet—I'm a one-man operation balancing a set of trailers and a family—but more "provisions" are coming. Whether it's gear for developers or something for the road, it has to meet the studio standard: <strong>Forged for Efficiency</strong>.

            I'm heading to bed now. Check out the new shop tab and let me know what you think.
