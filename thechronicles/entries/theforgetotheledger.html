    SUBJECT: The Lifecycle of Code<br>

<p><strong>This site isn't just a portfolio. It’s a foundry.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve been clicking around the shelves, you’ve noticed the distinct sectors: The Forge, The Rookery, and The Ledger. This structure isn't accidental—it’s the actual lifecycle of every piece of software built at Andy's Dev Studio. I want to break down exactly how a raw idea travels from a late-night prototype to a finished release, and where you fit into the machine.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1: The Forge (Raw Iron)</strong></p>
<p>Everything begins in <strong>The Forge</strong>. This is the sandbox. It’s where I drop experimental math engines, game mechanics, and utility prototypes that are still rough around the edges. When you load a project here, you aren't just playing a game—you are stress-testing the metal. </p>
<p>If a prototype sparks joy (or breaks spectacularly), use the <strong>Send a Raven</strong> link. Your feedback is the hammer that shapes the next version.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2: The Rookery (The Crucible)</strong></p>
<p>This is where things get serious. For an Android app to reach the Play Store today, Google demands a rigorous standard: <strong>20 testers opted-in for 14 continuous days</strong>. That is a massive hurdle for independent developers.</p>
<p><strong>The Rookery</strong> is our answer to that gate. When a project graduates from The Forge, it lands here for "The 14-Day Watch." This isn't just checking for bugs; it’s a community mission to clear the gates for release. If you see an app in the Rookery, I am asking for your shield and your time to get it across the finish line.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3: The Ledger (The Market)</strong></p>
<p>The final destination. Once the code is stabilized and the gates are cleared, the project moves to <strong>The Ledger</strong>. This is where you find the polished releases—available on the Play Store, Itch.io, or physically in the Cargo Bay. </p>

<p>The pipeline is simple: I forge the code, you test the limits, and together we ship the product. Welcome to the crew.</p>
