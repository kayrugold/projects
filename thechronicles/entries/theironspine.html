    ROUTE: The Iron Spine (Northbound Bobtail)
</p>

<p><strong>The brakes are set in the North Country.</strong></p>

<p>It was a long haul today—running the Spine down to the Lower Foundry, navigating the heavy traffic of the Nexus, and finally bobtailing back under the stars. The physical transition from the rumble of the road to the silence of the Forge is always the hardest gear to shift.</p>

<p><strong>The Standby State</strong></p>
<p>I tried to capture the Forge on film tonight, but the words wouldn't come. There’s a specific kind of fatigue that hits when your hands have been steady on a wheel for ten hours, but your mind is racing at a million bits per second. The video can stay in "Standby." Sometimes the best thing you can do for the code is let it breathe while the driver recovers.</p>

<p><strong>Refining the Embers</strong></p>
<p>Instead of the video, I spent my remaining fuel stoking the fire one last time. I’ve refined the atmospheric engine—added rising embers that glow without burning out the GPU. It’s a visual reminder that even when the math feels like it's at a standstill, there’s still heat in the system. The infrastructure is ready. Now, I wait for the next signal.</p>
