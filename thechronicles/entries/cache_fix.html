<h3>The Ghost in the Machine</h3>

<p>I lost a few hours today chasing a bug that didn't exist in the code, but lived in the browser's memory. I pushed an update to the Chronicles, but my phone kept loading the version from last week.</p>

<p><strong>The Culprit: Service Worker Caching.</strong></p>

<p>I set up a "Cache-First" strategy to make the app load instantly offline. It worked too well. It cached <code>index.html</code> and refused to check the network for the new manifest file.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Updated the <code>CACHE_NAME</code> in <code>sw.js</code> to <strong>v3</strong>.</li>
    <li>This forced the browser to treat the worker as "new" and discard the old cache.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lesson learned: Always include a versioning strategy or a "cache-busting" mechanism when deploying static apps that rely heavily on PWA features.</p>
