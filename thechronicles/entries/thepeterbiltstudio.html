<p><strong>The second shift begins when the engine stops.</strong></p>

<p>I just wrapped up an 11-hour run down the Iron Spine. The physical work is done—the freight is moved, the logbook is signed—but the mental work doesn't punch a clock. Sitting here in the cab at 2 AM, the lighting is terrible and the exhaustion is real, but this is the reality of the "Peterbilt Studio." It’s not about having the perfect ergonomic chair; it’s about having the drive to build something that is yours.</p>

<p><strong>The Ghost in the Cache</strong></p>
<p>Earlier today, the Studio hit a wall. We deployed a routine update, but the site refused to acknowledge it—a stubborn caching error that kept the old version locked in place. It’s the digital equivalent of a trailer door that won't seal. </p>

<p>I couldn't just leave it broken. So, on my break, I opened the terminal on my phone. With the help of "The Squire" (my AI co-pilot), we tore through the Service Worker logic. My eyes were tired from the road, but the Squire spotted the syntax break. We patched the file, flushed the cache, and pushed the hotfix live from the driver's seat.</p>

<p><strong>Status: Standby</strong></p>
<p>The fix is deployed, but the real test comes tomorrow morning. Tonight is for recovery. I’m heading home to be with the family, keeping the house quiet, and letting the code settle. The work is hard, the hours are long, but the system is evolving.</p>
